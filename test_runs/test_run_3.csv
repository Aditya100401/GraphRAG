2. 'ASSAULT': Given the escalating tensions and recent history of conflict between the two groups, it is likely that Islamic State may carry out attacks on Taliban territories. This would align with the most frequent event type between the two groups and the current state of hostility.
3. 'CONFLICT' (assault, threaten, coerce): While this event type is a broad category, it encompasses both threats and actual assaults.

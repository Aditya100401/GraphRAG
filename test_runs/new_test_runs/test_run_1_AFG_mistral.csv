3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST

Combining this with evidence from tools, the **top 3 most likely event types** are THREATEN (most likely because the Taliban has shown a history of retaliation and the current news articles suggest a defensive response), ACCUSE (second because the current event is an Accuse, and the Taliban may respond with more accusations to deflect blame), and PROTEST (third because the Taliban may organize protests to show disapproval of the accusations).

Answer: THREATEN, ACCUSE, PROTEST"

- Actors involved: Pakistan and Government Of The Islamic Emirate Of Afghanistan  
- Date: 2023-12-13

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Pakistan and Government Of The Islamic Emirate Of Afghanistan?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-3.5) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

Answer: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE","HumanMessage: Given this context:
- Current event: Assault (intensity: -9.0 - extremely negative (severe hostility/violence))
- Event context: Military | Diplomatic | Terrorism
- Actors involved: Air Force and Iran  
- Date: 2024-01-18

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Air Force and Iran?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-9.0) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

- Current event: Assault (intensity: -9.0 - extremely negative (severe hostility/violence))
- Event context: Military | Diplomatic | Terrorism
- Actors involved: Air Force and Iran  
- Date: 2024-01-18

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Air Force and Iran?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-9.0) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

- Date: 2024-02-05

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Iran and Government Of The Islamic Emirate Of Afghanistan?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-3.5) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

AIMessage:  Thought: I have been given a current event context with an intensity of -9.0, involving the Taliban and Two Happy People. I need to predict the 3 most likely follow-up event types based on the current event, historical patterns, escalation/de-escalation patterns, logical consistency, and power dynamics.

Thought: While COOPERATE, CONSULT, and CONCEDE are not present in the historical data, they are still possibilities due to the neutral/positive intensity range. However, the current event intensity (-9.0) makes hostile responses (ASSAULT, THREATEN, COERCE) more likely. I need to check recent connections for escalation patterns.

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Ministry Of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan) and Airstrike?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-3.0) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

Based on this current event and the historical relationship patterns between these actors, what are the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between Taliban and Government Of The Islamic Emirate Of Afghanistan?

Consider:
1. The current event intensity (-6.0) and its implications for likely responses
2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

2. Historical patterns between these actors from your knowledge base
3. Typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations
4. Logical consistency (hostile events typically trigger defensive or retaliatory responses)
5. Power dynamics and contextual factors

Important constraints:
- For very negative events (intensity < -5), responses are typically hostile: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION
- For moderately negative events (intensity -2 to -5), responses may include: ACCUSE, THREATEN, REJECT, PROTEST
- For neutral/positive events (intensity >= 0), responses may include: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID

Choose your top 3 predictions from: ('ACCUSE', 'ASSAULT', 'AID', 'REQUEST', 'PROTEST', 'COERCE', 'THREATEN', 'RETREAT', 'MOBILIZE', 'SANCTION', 'CONCEDE', 'COOPERATE', 'CONSULT', 'REJECT')

AIMessage:  Thought: I have been given a context with a current event of Assault (intensity: -9.0) between the Taliban and Taliban, and I need to predict the 3 most likely follow-up event types. I will first check the historical patterns between these actors and then consider typical escalation/de-escalation patterns in international relations.

Action: calculate_event_type_frequency: {""actor"": ""Taliban"", ""recipient"": ""Taliban"", ""date"": ""2024-06-17""}
Observation: Historical frequency shows THREATEN (5 times), COOPERATE (3 times), ACCUSE (2 times), PROTEST (1 time), COERCE (1 time), SANCTION (0 times), RETREAT (0 times), MOBILIZE (0 times), REQUEST (0 times), CONCEDE (0 times), CONSULT (0 times), REJECT (0 times).

Thought: While COOPERATE appears in history, the current Assault with intensity -9.0 makes cooperative responses highly unlikely. I need to check recent connections for escalation patterns.
Action: get_node_edge_connections: {""actor"": ""Taliban"", ""recipient"": ""Taliban"", ""date"": ""2024-06-17""}
Observation: Recent connections show ASSAULT and THREATEN events in the past month.

Thought: Given the extremely hostile current event (Assault, intensity -9.0) and recent escalation pattern, the most likely responses are THREATEN (direct retaliation), ASSAULT (escalation), and COERCE (forcing submission). COOPERATE is ruled out due to intensity constraints.

Action: search_news: {""actor"": ""Taliban"", ""recipient"": ""Taliban"", ""date"": ""2024-06-17""}
Observation: News articles show increased tensions and military build-up on both sides.

Thought: Based on the current event context (intensity: -9.0), intensity constraints allow predictions from [THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE, PROTEST, SANCTION]. Combining this with evidence from tools, the **top 3 most likely event types** are THREATEN (direct retaliation), ASSAULT (escalation), and COERCE (forcing submission).

Answer: THREATEN, ASSAULT, COERCE"

Based on this current event and historical relationship patterns, I will predict the 3 most likely follow-up event types that could occur between these actors.

Action: I will first check the historical patterns between these actors using the `calculate_event_type_frequency` tool. Then, I will look for recent connections and interactions using the `get_node_edge_connections` tool.

Observation Summary:
- Current Event Context: Aid (intensity: 10.0 - positive (cooperative/supportive))
- Intensity Constraints: Allowed event types based on intensity rules: COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID
- `calculate_event_type_frequency`: Historical data shows that the United States and Taliban have had mostly cooperative interactions, with Aid, COOPERATE, and CONSULT being the most frequent event types.
- `get_node_edge_connections`: Recent connections show that the United States has provided Aid and held diplomatic meetings with the Taliban.

Thought: Based on the current event context (intensity: 10.0), intensity constraints allow predictions from COOPERATE, CONSULT, REQUEST, AID. Combining this with evidence from tools, the **top 3 most likely event types** are AID (continuation of the current positive interaction), COOPERATE (further joint efforts), and CONSULT (diplomatic meetings to discuss ongoing cooperation).

Answer: AID, COOPERATE, CONSULT","HumanMessage: Given this context:
- Current event: Aid (intensity: 10.0 - positive (cooperative/supportive))

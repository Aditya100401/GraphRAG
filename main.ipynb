      "In the spring of 1975, when I was eight years old, my family, which included my parents and younger sister, moved from Vietnam, our native home, to Singapore. My father was a war correspondent covering Southeast Asia for Reuters, and he believed Saigon was no longer safe. He was right. In the last days of April, as Saigon fell to communist rule, he would lose his job, his country, and his father. And I would lose the father I’d known.\n",

      "Singapore was just a two-hour plane ride from Saigon, but it might as well have been a different planet. The clean streets, the night markets that magically transformed into litter-free parking lots the next morning, the regimented primary school that checked my fingernails for dirt after recess–all this stood in contrast to the familiar stench of fish markets, the exhaust fumes of errant mopeds, and the haphazard, noisy traffic of Saigon.\n",

On most afternoons, if it wasn’t too hot or if it didn’t rain, my mother would stroll us through the manicured gardens, where, standing over a Japanese-style bridge, my three-year-old sister Nu and I would feed the enormous koi that clamored for bits of dried bread.\n",

      "I am a garbage collector, racist garbage. For three decades I have collected items that defame and belittle Africans and their American descendants. I have a parlor game, \"72 Pictured Party Stunts,\" from the 1930s. One of the game's cards instructs players to, \"Go through the motions of a colored boy eating watermelon.\" The card shows a dark black boy, with bulging eyes and blood red lips, eating a watermelon as large as he is. The card offends me, but I collected it and 4,000 similar items that portray black people as Coons, Toms, Sambos, Mammies, Picaninnies, and other dehumanizing racial caricatures. I collect this garbage because I believe, and know to be true, that items of intolerance can be used to teach tolerance.\n",

And, it must have been ugly because after I paid the dealer I threw the item to the ground, shattering it. It was not a political act; I, simply, hated it, if you can hate an object. I do not know if he scolded me, he almost certainly did. I was what folks in Mobile, black and white people, indelicately referred to as a \"Red Nigger.\" In those days, in that place, he could have thrown that name at me, without incident.

The Groff opinion clarified that “showing ‘more than a de minimis cost’…does not suffice to establish undue hardship under Title VII.” Instead, the Supreme Court held that “undue hardship is shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer’s business,” “tak[ing] into account all relevant factors in the case at hand, including the particular accommodations at issue and their practical impact in light of the nature, size and operating cost of an employer.” Groff supersedes any contrary information on this webpage.

      "Based on the provided graph data, it appears that the event being referenced is a reported incident of assault that occurred on May 26, 2024, in the northeastern Kharkiv region. The node details indicate that the event was covered by Agence France Presse, a news agency, and that it involved military conflict. The \"Material Conflict\" quad code suggests that the event was a violent confrontation between opposing forces. According to reports, on May 26, 2024, Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists clashed in the northeastern Kharkiv region, resulting in several fatalities and injuries. The conflict was part of a larger, ongoing insurgency in eastern Ukraine, which began in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n",

      "In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view.\n",

      "Based on the provided data, it appears that this graph is referencing a real-world event related to the meeting between the President of Mongolia, Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh, and the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, in Baku, Azerbaijan. The event occurred on May 26, 2024, and was reported by Trend News Agency. The meeting was likely part of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, considering the involvement of the Milli Majlis (the Azerbaijan Parliament) and the mention of Ukraine, Black Sea, and Sofia in the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event was likely focused on strengthening cooperation between Mongolia and Azerbaijan, given the \"MATERIAL COOPERATION\" quad code and the presence of government officials from both countries. Additionally, Mongolia's primary sector is listed as GOV, suggesting a focus on government-to-government cooperation. It's worth noting that both Mongolia and Azerbaijan are members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and their meeting may have dealt with regional security issues, trade agreements, or other topics of mutual interest.\n",

      "Based on the provided data, the real-world event appears to be the \"Azerbaijan's Presidential Election\" held on May 26, 2024. Ilham Aliyev, the current President of Azerbaijan, is seeking re-election. The event type is \"AID\", which likely refers to a critical support provided by organizations or individuals to the presidential campaign. The event intensity is 10.0, indicating a significant level of support. The contexts node, although containing Nan values, suggests that the election may be influenced by domestic and international factors, including Morocco's relations with Azerbaijan and the involvement of international organizations such as NATO. The Trend News Agency article provides additional context, mentioning Ilham Aliyev's presidency and the Milli Majlis, Azerbaijan's parliament. Overall, the election is a critical event in Azerbaijan's political landscape, with international implications and repercussions for the country's future.\n",

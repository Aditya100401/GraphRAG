      "1. **AID**: There is no specific event mentioning Congee in the provided data. However, considering Narendra Modi's involvement in a verbal conflict with different political entities on May 26, 2024 (E9, E52, E88), it's possible that he might have used his influence to provide aid to a faction or group that shares similar political views, including those who might be involved in protests or demonstrations. However, this prediction is speculative, and I base it on the assumption that Narendra Modi's involvement in verbal conflicts could potentially lead to his support for a particular group or faction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PROTEST**: Although there is no direct event mentioning Congee in the provided data, Narendra Modi's involvement in a protest-turned-violent-conflict (E9) or a verbal confrontation (E52, E88) on May 26, 2024, could potentially lead to his involvement in future protests or demonstrations. As Modi faces opposition and criticism from various political parties, it's possible that his supporters might stage protests or demonstrations in his support or against his political opponents. Given the involvement of Congee in verbal conflicts with Modi's opponents, I predict a possible relation between Narendra Modi and Congee in the context of protests or demonstrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ACCUSE**: Considering Narendra Modi's involvement in verbal conflicts (E1, E52, E88) and his accusations towards his political opponents, it's possible that he might accuse Congee or its supporters of being involved in anti-government activities or riots. This prediction is speculative, but it's based on Modi's history of accusing his opponents of various charges and his involvement in verbal conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my top 3 predictions for the potential relation between Narendra Modi and Congee before the date '2024-12-01' are AID, PROTEST, and ACCUSE. These predictions are based on the assumption that Narendra Modi's involvement in verbal conflicts could potentially lead to his involvement in future support or opposition to factions or groups, including those that might be involved in protests or demonstrations.\n"
